    <p class = "subtitle">SO WHAT DO YOU WEAR TO AN INTERVIEW?</p>
    <p class = "paragraph">It mostly depends on which company you're working for.</p>
    <hr>

      <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">The type of company</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Before you go to an interview, you should research the company that you're going to be applying for. If they are a casual company you should dress likewise. If they're a stricter company, you should dress professionally. The best way to tell if a company is casual is to check whether they're a startup. Most startups are casual and prefer casual people.</p>

      <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">What to Wear</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now that you know what type of company you're going to be interviewing for, you should choose the type of dress that you're going to wear. </p>

        <p class="boldparagraph">Business Professional</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If you're working for a company that has a business professional dress code, then you should go with a business professional outfit i.e. suits. Men should wear a blazer or suit jacket with a button down shirt, suit pants, belt and shoes. Women should wear a skirt or pant suit with heels.</p>
        <p class="boldparagraph">Business Casual</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If you're working for a company that has a business casual dress code, then you shouldn't wear the suit. Men should wear dress slacks or chinos with a button down or a polo shirt. Women might wear a conservative dress or a blouse with a skirt or dress pants and shoes or boots.</p>
        <p class="boldparagraph">Casual</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If you're working for a company with a casual dress code, you should still look professional. Men might wear a long-sleeved dress shirt, khaki pants, a belt, and dress shoes. Women might wear a collared shirt with pants or a pencil skirt, or a work dress.</p>
