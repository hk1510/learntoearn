      <p class = "subtitle">SO HOW DO YOU WRITE YOUR RESUME AND COVER LETTER?</p>

      <hr>

        <p class="sub-subtitle">RESUMES</p>
          <p class = "paragraph">A Resume is what gets you an interview. It gives the employers an overview of your past education, skills, qualification and experience.</p>
          <br>

        <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">Gather the Information!</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Before you do anything, you need to gather your information about your education, work experience and skills. After that gather all the other information you will need in you resume such as contact information and certifications.</p>
          <br>

        <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">Time to write!</p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 2em;">Write your resume in one of these three formats:</p>
          <p class="boldparagraph">1. Chronological</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Use this format if you have had a lot of previous work history.</p>
          <div class = "imagebox1">
            <div class="imageholder3">
              <img class="linkimage" src = "https://susanireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ChronTemp.gif">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="boldparagraph">2. Functional</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Use this format if you have no work history and want to emphasize your skills.</p>
          <div class = "imagebox1">
            <div class="imageholder3">
              <img class="linkimage" src = "https://susanireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/FunTemp.gif">
              <p class="paragraph2">Image courtesy of susanireland.com</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="boldparagraph">3. Combination</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Use this format if you want to put an emphasis on both your work history and your skills.</p>
          <div class = "imagebox1">
            <div class="imageholder3">
              <img class = "linkimage" src = "https://susanireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/CombinationResumeTemplategif-1.gif">
              <p class="paragraph2">Image courtesy of susanireland.com</p>
            </div>
          </div>
            <br>
          <p class = "paragraph">Make sure that you only include what you need. Being clear and concise is more important than providing too much irrelevant information. You can include information about volunteering and what-not, but only include it if it is related to your job. It is also highly recommended to keep your resume a one-pager.</p>
          <br>
        <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">Proofread!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">After you are done writing your resume, make sure there are no grammatical errors. Having a friend or a relative read over it is a very good idea. They can better spot mistakes that you otherwise wouldn't notice.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="sub-subtitle">COVER LETTERS</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">A Cover Letter is sent along with your resume in order to complement it. It is not an exact copy of your resume. Instead, it is a document that tells your employer why you're a good fit for the job.</p>
            <br>

          <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">Brainstorm!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A cover letter is going to use your qualifications to pursuade the employer to hire you. In order to write a good cover letter, you need to first brainstorm your qualifications. Once you have a list, you can then choose the qualifications that will help you get the job.</p>
            <br>

          <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">Time to write!</p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 1em;">It is time to write your cover letter! There are some things that you should and shouldn't include in your cover letter.</p>
            <p class="boldparagraph">What to include:</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In order to write a good cover letter, you need to explain the experiences and skills that will help you get the job. You need to think about which skills are the most revelant to the job you're applying for. In most cases, that should be all that you should include in your cover letter: why you're fit for the job and what skills support that statement.</p>
            <p class="boldparagraph">What not to include:</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Some things just shouldn't be included in cover letters. This includes anything personal. A cover letter doesn't cover your personality. That's for the interview. What it does cover is your qualifications. It should be short and concise: A first introduction to your skills and why you should get the job.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Here's an example cover letter:</p>
            <div class="imagebox1">
            <div class="imageholder3">
              <img class="linkimage" src = "Images/ceo-sample-cover-letter.jpg">
            </div>
            </div>
              <br>
            <br>
          <p class="sub-sub-subtitle">Proofread!</p>
          <p class="paragraph">After you are done writing your cover letter, you have to make sure that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ERRORS WHATSOEVER. A cover letter is usually the first thing that your employer will read and it will be the first impression that you give them.</p>
